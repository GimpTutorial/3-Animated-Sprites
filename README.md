## Section 3 - Animated Sprites - Lecture List AS_GMP
Here are the lectures of the course for this section...

### 1_AS_GMP Bonus Section Introduction
+ Michael Introduces what it coming up in Section 3

### 2_AS_GMP What is Animation
+ Animation is an illusion of motion
+ Images are our Frames
+ The images are shown to us at a regular iterval, called frames per second.

### 3_AS_GMP Setting Up Gimp For Animation
+ Layer Order
+ Previewing the animation
+ Exporting as a GIF

### 4_AS_GMP Deciding On Frame Rate
+ Direct impact on output
+ Yes can be changed later and in game
+ Higher FPS means inserting frames, lowers means cutting them to keep the same animation.


### 5_AS_GMP Layer Animation Parameters
#### Different Layer Options

+ (ms) eg (100ms) : Time that the frame will be showed for.
+ (combine) : Mixes the current frame with the one before it- useful with alpha layers
+ (replace) Replaces the previous frame regardless of any layers having an alpha layer

Note, the order matters as do the brackets and spacing
Recommended Example:  LayerName (100ms)(replace)
