## Section 3 - Animated Sprites - Lecture List AS_GMP
Here are the lectures of the course for this section...

### 1_AS_GMP Bonus Section Introduction
+ Michael Introduces what it coming up in Section 3

### 2_AS_GMP What is Animation
+ Animation is an illusion of motion
+ Images are our Frames
+ The images are shown to us at a regular iterval, called frames per second.

### 3_AS_GMP Setting Up Gimp For Animation
+ Layer Order
+ Previewing the animation
+ Exporting as a GIF

### 4_AS_GMP Deciding On Frame Rate
+ Direct impact on output
+ Yes can be changed later and in game
+ Higher FPS means inserting frames, lowers means cutting them to keep the same animation.


### 5_AS_GMP Layer Animation Parameters
#### Different Layer Options

+ (ms) eg (100ms) : Time that the frame will be showed for.
+ (combine) : Mixes the current frame with the one before it- useful with alpha layers
+ (replace) Replaces the previous frame regardless of any layers having an alpha layer

Note, the order matters as do the brackets and spacing
Recommended Example:  LayerName (100ms)(replace)

### 6_AS_GMP Layer Boundaries

+ Controlling and optimising layer boundaries

### 7_AS_GMP Squash And Stretch
+ We wonâ€™t cover them all in this section.
+ Recommended book: Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life
+ Start with squash and stretch and apply that to an animation.

### 8_AS_GMP Making a Bouncing Ball
+ Create a 2 second animation, at 10fps.
+ Ball falling off a ledge and hitting the ground

### 9_AS_GMP Multi Layer Images And Animation
+ You can have a layered animation by using Layer Groups
+ Layer Groups respect previous layer visibilities

### 10_AS_GMP Straight Ahead And Pose To Pose
+ Neighter of these techiques are exclusive, mixing them is fine.
+ Picking the appropirate one can be a huge time saver

#### Straight Ahead
+ Very goof for unpredicable animation like flames water and smoke
+ Works becuase it requires the previous frame for the current one

#### Pose To Pose
+ Gives the most control
+ Get a good idea of the whole scene early on, catching any issues
+ Helps keep consistency throughout an animation
+ Your character or ojbect ends up in the right place

### 11_AS_GMP GIFs And Layer Groups
+ How to organise layergroups so that your animations can be layered
+ Workflow ideas to speed up multi-layer animations

### 12_AS_GMP Slow In And Out
+ How to make animation seem less robotic and more natual
+ Techniques for creating more convincing movement
